### When explain Cost Function, Why used J($\theta$)

when study GAN, explained cost function using J function.

Exactly what is J function?

anwser is here -> [What does the capital letter 'J' mean in cost function J(θ)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42420235/what-does-the-capital-letter-j-mean-in-cost-function-j%CE%B8)

> I saw many people using 'J(θ)' to represent cost function, what does the capital letter 'J' exactly mean?
>> it comes from the Jacobian Matrix which represents the derivitave in all the directions
